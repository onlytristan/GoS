# GoS
My GoS scripts, enjoy.

Please comment at my thread if you find any bugs in my scripts so i can improve the script and fix those bugs.

If you enjoy my scripts, make sure to upvote in my thread and in GoSDB i'll really appreciate it!

Guide to use my scripts:

1. Download the file ChampionName.lua (ChampionName is for example: Annie, Morgana, Fiddlesticks, etc.)
2. Place it in your GoS/LOL/Scripts/Common folder.
3. You don't have to require it in testscript1.lua, if you don't save the file as DatChampionName.lua.
